The Rhonda Weiss Center for Accessible IDEA Data (Weiss Center) provides technical assistance to state education agencies (SEAs) to improve and enhance the capacity to collect, report, analyze, and use accurate data, required under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B Sections 616 and 618 and Part C, in dynamic, accessible formats.

**Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973**

Additionally, we comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which ensures that individuals with disabilities have equal access to digital information and technology, which aligns with the inclusive principles of IDEA.
